	<!-- EDIT THE DESCRIPTION HERE -->
	This map shows 4 good pubs in the Central Otago region, with the intention of showing a route to travel between all four for a good day out. It also warns users away from an awful zone where there are no pubs at all.
	I have made the polygon an orange colour, to indicate danger, while making it relatively transparent so as not to overwhelm the map.
	A relatively traditional looking font has been used for geographic locations, in the spirit of traditional English Pubs. Label size has been used to indicate settlement size, with bigger labels (and visible further zoomed out) for larger settlements.
	Overall colours have been kept muted to not distract.Buildings have also been shown to add context.
	A hierarchy has been applied to roads, with a grey palette used becoming darker and thicker for major roads.
	TA boundaries have been shown with grey line and no fill, so as not to draw the eye.
